# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2018

Some of us at work (https://www.thomasnet.com) are competing in a private leaderboard and sharing our code.

Each numbered directory contains that day's code. Within each dir, 1.js is part one and 2.js is part two. For example, to run part 1 of day 2:

```
cd 2
npm install
pbpaste | ./1.js
```
